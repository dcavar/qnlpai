				<p>Authors can submit their work in the form of a complete paper or an abstract.</p>

				<p>Complete papers can be submitted as a Regular Paper, representing completed and validated research.</p>

				<p>An abstract can be submitted to the Abstracts Track, either because the work done represents a very early stage of research, or because the authors wish to present to the audience the results of an already published paper. In the latter case the paper cannot be republished. However, the authors can attach to the abstract a complete paper or a video, if permission to share any such complementing materials is provided. The abstract itself can only have a limited number of pages, see below.</p>

				<p>Authors should submit a paper in English, carefully checked for correct grammar and spelling, addressing one or several of the conference areas or topics. Each paper should clearly indicate the nature of its technical/scientific contribution, and the problems, domains or environments to which it is applicable. The use of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated text in an article should be disclosed in the acknowledgements section of any paper submitted to this conference. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text should include a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.</p>

				<p>To facilitate the double-blind paper evaluation method, authors are kindly requested to produce and provide the paper WITHOUT any reference to any of the authors, including the authors' personal details, the acknowledgments section of the paper and any other reference that may disclose the authors' identity.</p>

				<p>When submitting a complete paper please note that only original papers should be submitted. Authors are advised to read <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism-overview" target="_blank">ACM's ethical norms regarding plagiarism and self-plagiarism</a> thoroughly before submitting and must make sure that their submissions do not substantially overlap work which has been published elsewhere or simultaneously submitted to a journal or another conference with proceedings. Papers that contain any form of plagiarism will be rejected without reviews. Authors should also avoid using an excessive number of self-citations.</p>

				<p>All papers must be submitted through the online submission platform <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/QNLPAI2025/" target="_blank">Microsoft Conference Management Toolkit</a> (<a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/QNLPAI2025/" target="_blank">CMT</a>) and should follow the instructions and templates that can be found under Guidelines and Templates. After the paper submission has been successfully completed, authors will receive an automatic confirmation e-mail.</p>

				<h4>Reviewing Process</h4>
				<h5>Complete Papers</h5>

				<p>All reviews follow a double-blind process. All papers are subject to plagiarism analysis using a software tool prior to review.</p>

				<p>All regular papers are reviewed by at least two reviewers, but usually by three or more, and rated considering their: Relevance, Originality, Technical Quality, Significance and Presentation;</p>

				<p>The reviewers are also asked to answer a group of questions that may help the authors to improve the paper, should it be accepted, namely: Abstract and Introduction are adequate?, Needs more experimental results?, Needs comparative evaluation?, Improve critical discussion?, Figures are Adequate?, Conclusions/Future Work are convincing?, References are up-to-date and appropriate?, Paper formatting needs adjustment?, Improve English?</p>

				<p>Finally, the reviewers can provide some free text observations which was given to the authors and also some free text private observations, made available only to the program chair. Conflicting reviews may require assignment of a new reviewer. In the end the program chairs decide. The author has a period for rebuttal, which triggers a workflow involving the chairs and the reviewers if necessary. All rebuttals are answered but decisions are final.</p>

				<p>Position papers follow a similar process but the criteria used for classification are slightly different in order to account for the nature of these papers, i.e. speculative ideas and/or ongoing work not yet fully validated.</p>

				<h5>Abstracts</h5>

				<p>The submissions will be reviewed by a panel of experts, including the conference and program chairs. In order to ensure a proper and fair review of the abstracts, we encourage authors to submit abstracts with clear insights and background of the work, and to include complementing material that can help the panel understand its contribution and relevance to the conference. Complementing material could include, for example, previously published papers or videos related to the abstract, to enrich the abstract submission. All abstracts will be analyzed, however insufficient proof of scientific and/or novel contribution, as well as lack of background and grounds to understand what is being proposed, may lead to the rejection of an abstract.</p>

				<p>In order to evaluate the technical quality, the submitted abstract should contain clear though summary indication regarding the data used for experiments, the exploited methods and the achieved results.</p>


				<h4>Conference Paper Formats</h4>
				<h5>Regular Papers</h5>

				<p>Submission: Regular Papers should be submitted ready for double-blind review (no authors identified), as pdf files, 4 (short paper) or 8 pages (full paper) and additional pages for references and an optional appendix.</p>

				<p>Acceptance: After a double-blind peer review, qualifying Regular Papers may be accepted as either Full Papers or Short Papers.</p>

				<p>Presentation: Regular Papers classified as Full Papers are awarded a 25 minutes slot for an oral presentation at the conference. Regular Papers classified as Short Papers are given either a 20 minutes slot for an oral presentation or assigned to present at a Poster Session. Authors who have been assigned an oral presentation, either Full or Short, may however also choose to present at a Poster Session instead, should they prefer it. All presentations are in-person.</p>

				<p><b>Publication:</b> Regular Papers classified as Full Papers will be assigned a 12-page limit in the Conference Proceedings, while Regular Papers classified as Short Papers have an 8-page limit. The Conference Post-Proceedings will be published with Springer in the series Communications in Computer and Information Sciences (CCIS) (<b>ISBN number to be announced)</b>) and include final versions of all accepted and presented papers, adjusted to satisfy reviewers' recommendations.</p>

				<h5>Abstracts</h5>

				<p>Submission: Authors can submit a 1-page abstract and may include, as complementing material, a previously published paper or a video link.</p>

				<p>Acceptance: The submissions will be screened by a panel of experts, including the conference and program chairs and can be accepted as Short Papers. Acceptance will indicate, for each paper, also its form of presentation.</p>

				<p>Presentation: Abstracts that bring an appropriate complementing material are eligible for oral or poster presentation; otherwise, they are eligible for poster presentation only. Oral presentations are given a 20 minutes time slot. Authors who have been assigned an oral presentation may however choose to present at a Poster Session instead, should they prefer it.</p>

				<p>Publication: Abstracts will be advertised in the conference program and in the conference book of abstracts (in the printed and digital version), and may be published as short papers in the proceedings, according to the decision of the reviewers.</p>

                <h5>Student Poster Session</h5>

                <p>Submission: Authors should submit a 1-page abstract as specified above for Abstracts submissions, and in addition a draft poster in PDF format.</p>

                <p style="color: red;">The poster size should not be larger than 48 inches wide by 36 inches high (48" x 36").</p>
